Together, Jeff and I are fortunate to have many of the essential household items that we need already. The very best present we can receive is your presence at our wedding and your love and support 
as we embark on this adventure together. We recognize that especially for those of you coming from far away, simply attending our wedding will already entail spending money on travel and hotel 
accommodations. Homemade, handmade, and second hand gifts are welcomed and appreciated. Many of you are contributing your time and energy to this event, and for the gift of your participation we thank you.
To make it easier for the more traditional gift givers among you, we have set up a registry at [Bed Bath & Beyond](http://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/store/giftregistry/view_registry_guest.jsp?pwsToken=&eventType=Wedding&registryId=542848111&pwsurl=), [Target](https://www-secure.target.com/gift-registry/giftgiver?registryId=TdfXUa5SRz5J0SyVsvjCQA&lnk=copiedLink) and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/registry/wedding/4DQDNCRL1ZC6).

Gil, Munny, Credits, or Rupees are also acceptable.
