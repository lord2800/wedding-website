We plan to have a live band playing! Dancing not required ;)

The band we have chosen is a lovely group based out of San Francisco. They are a 3 piece band that are going to be playing in the style of french gypsy jazz. 

In my opinion its a lovely mix of folksy swing without the brass. I love the genre and they will perform a wide variety of songs in the gypsy jazz style of music. 

It was a way of combining our eclectic choice of music in a cohesive manner! We hope you enjoy


If you have a song suggestion please let us know! They might be able to work it in!
