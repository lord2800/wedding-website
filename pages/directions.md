# Formal wear? Inconceivable!

Seriously, we're geeks, people. Okayâ€¦ so for our wedding we might look a bit more spiffy than usual, but we encourage all our guests to dress in whatever they feel is comfortable.
We're not responsible for what happens if you decide to wear a red shirt though. ;)

(Please do keep in mind though, that we are planning an outdoor, evening ceremony. Consider bringing a warm layer for the evening! High heels and uncomfortable formal wear are not recommended.)

# Directions

&#42; A portion of the road to their house is unpaved and can be quite narrow and bumpy. Please keep this in mind when choosing your mode of transportation.

&#42; It's been brought to our attention that the Google map pin is off by .6 miles. To avoid any confusion, the actual location is 2 miles on Sharp Rd with the last half mile being a dirt road.
